Welcome to OpenDNP3, a portable, rigorously-tested, Apache-licensed
implementation of the DNP3 protocol (aka IEEE-1815).

!!! warning

    DNP3 is a complex protocol with many subtle rules. This guide and the
    [OpenDNP3](https://dnp3.github.io) project cannot cover everything about the
    protocol. To successfully use OpenDNP3 or develop a product based on it, you
    will almost certainly need a copy of the specification. We recommend that
    your organization joins [DNP.org](https://www.dnp.org) to obtain a copy.
